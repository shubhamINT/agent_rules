# Variant: HireBot Python layout (layered by layer)

The layout existing HireBot Python services use. It is **layered by technical
layer**, with one HireBot-specific meaning to watch: here `services/` holds
**external I/O clients only** (one directory per upstream), and business logic
lives in `src/<domain>/`. In the generic layered layouts (`python-layouts.md`)
`services/` means use-case logic instead. When a repo uses this variant, record
that definition in its `## Project structure` section.

Choose this variant when the repo already follows it. For new services the
default proposal is layered-by-feature (see `python-layouts.md`).

```

Grow it by adding siblings at the right layer, never by nesting a new concern
inside an unrelated one.

## Layer rules

Each rule below exists because breaking it is what actually rots a service.

**`server.py` is wiring, not logic.** Routers, middleware, lifespan, exception
handlers. If it contains a business rule, that rule belongs in `src/<domain>/`.

**`src/api/` is the HTTP surface only.** A route function validates input,
delegates, and shapes the response. No queries, no external calls, no branching
business rules inside a route body. Shared dependencies (auth, tenant header)
live in a `_common.py` in the route package, not duplicated per route.

**`src/api/models/` holds pydantic models, one file per scope** (`common.py`,
`<feature>.py`, `response_schemas.py`). Never mix models into route modules.

**`src/services/` is external I/O and nothing else.** One directory per upstream
system. Each service module exposes the pair:

- `call_<x>_endpoint(...)` — performs the request
- `condense_<x>_response(...)` — strips envelope noise at the boundary, so callers
  never see the upstream's wire format

**Condense at the boundary.** Upstream payloads are normalised the moment they
arrive. Envelope noise must not leak upward into domain code.

**`src/core/config.py` owns configuration.** One `Settings` class, one module-level
singleton, every value read there. Scattered `os.getenv` calls elsewhere are a
defect — they hide the config surface and break `.env.example`.

**One response envelope.** Success *and* every error path return the same shape.
Register exception handlers centrally in `server.py` so no route hand-rolls an
error body.

**`tests/` mirrors `src/`.** `src/services/rag/rag_service.py` →
`tests/services/rag/test_rag_service.py`. Non-trivial logic leaves at least one runnable check.

**One responsibility per file.** If a file needs a table of contents, split it.
Typical split: `builder.py` (construction) + `prompts.py`/`models.py` (data) +
`<x>_service.py` (I/O).

**One job per function.** If describing it needs the word "and", split it.

**Names tell the story.** `snake_case` modules, no `utils.py` dumping ground, no
`tmp`, `data2`, `handleStuff`. A public name should reveal intent without the body.

**No dead code.** Delete it. Never leave commented-out blocks behind.

**Docstrings on public functions/classes** stating *what* and *why*. The code
already shows *how*.

## Where does this new file go?

| It … | Put it in |
|------|-----------|
| defines an HTTP endpoint | `src/api/routes/` (versioned subdir if the API is versioned) |
| is a request/response shape | `src/api/models/` |
| talks to a third-party or sibling service over the network | `src/services/<upstream>/` |
| encodes a business rule or orchestration | `src/<domain>/` |
| reads env / configures the process | `src/core/config.py` (extend, don't add a new config module) |
| defines error types / registers exception handlers | `src/core/exceptions.py` (registered centrally in `server.py`) |
| touches the database | `src/core/db/` (`db_schema.py` for models, `functions/` for queries) |
| wraps every request | `src/core/middleware/` |
| is a test | `tests/`, named after the module under test |

## New service scaffold

Minimum viable repo — do not scaffold layers nothing uses yet. Add
`src/<domain>/`, `src/core/db/`, and `src/core/middleware/` when the first real
need arrives, not "for later" (`src/services/` likewise appears only once the
first upstream client exists).

```
server.py  pyproject.toml  README.md  .env.example  Dockerfile  AGENTS.md
