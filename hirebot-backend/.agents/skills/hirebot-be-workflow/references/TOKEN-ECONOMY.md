# Token Economy

Context is a budget. Every token spent on filler, a re-read file, or a
400-line log pushes out something that matters, and costs money. Quality comes
from evidence, not from volume. Spend tokens on what changes the result:
scope, root cause, design decisions, verification.

In an agent session most tokens are **input**: files read, tool output,
test logs. Output text is the smallest share. So the biggest savings come from
reading less and building less. Short replies come last.

## 1. Read cheap (biggest lever)

- Search, then read: find the symbol with grep or glob, then read the range
  around it. Do not read whole files to find one function. Before you edit a
  file, read enough of it to understand it (imports, callers, neighbours):
  saving tokens never means editing code you have not read.
- Read a file once. Do not re-read a file you just read or edited, unless it
  changed on disk or it is no longer in your context (after a summary or a
  long gap).
- Trim tool output at the source: `tail -40`, `grep -n`, `head`, a quiet or
  dot reporter for tests, one test file instead of the suite while iterating.
  Quote only the decisive line.
- A pipe hides the exit code (`cmd | tail` returns `tail`'s status). Use
  `set -o pipefail`, or redirect to a file, check `$?`, then read the tail.
- Delegate broad sweeps (many files, "where is X used") to a subagent. It
  returns compressed findings (`SUBAGENTS.md`), not file dumps.
- Do not reload a skill or reference already loaded in this session.

**Test and log output is the most expensive input.** A full suite run or a
raw log can cost thousands of tokens for one useful line.

- While iterating, run the one test file or test id you are working on
  (`pytest path/test_x.py::test_y -q --tb=short -x`, `vitest run path -t name`).
  Run the full suite once at the end of each step.
- Read failures, not passes: `-q`, `--tb=short`, a dot reporter.
- Filter logs before reading: `grep -n "ERROR\|Traceback" app.log | tail -20`,
  or the request id you are chasing.
- Diffs: `git diff --stat` first, then only the files that matter.

## 2. Build less

Less code is fewer tokens to write, read, review, and fix. Before writing,
stop at the first step that works:

1. Does it need to exist? No caller today means skip it, and say so in one line.
2. Does the standard library or platform do it? Use it: a database
   constraint over app code, `functools.lru_cache` over a cache class.
3. Does the repo already have it? Use the existing helper, service, or
   installed dependency.
4. Only then write the smallest diff that works (coding rule "Simplest thing
   that works").

Take the first option that works. Weighing all four is itself wasted thinking.
When two options are the same size, take the one that is correct on edge
cases. "Build less" is about code, not about the agreed result: approved
features, states, polish, and tests are needed, not extra.

## 3. Think to the point

- Think in short notes: facts, decision, next action. Do not restate the
  request, narrate tool calls, or draft the reply twice.
- Decide once. Settled decisions live in `scope.md` and `plan.md`; do not
  re-argue them.
- Think longer only where it pays: root cause, design direction, a risky
  trade-off. Mechanical steps (rename, copy a template, run a check) need
  none.
- The host's reasoning-effort setting is the real control over thinking
  length, and it belongs to the user. For long mechanical tasks you may
  suggest a lower setting. Do not change it yourself.

## 4. Reply short

- Chat: result first. No preamble, recap, pleasantries, hedging, or tool
  narration. Tables and lists over paragraphs. State each fact once.
- Keep exact: identifiers, paths, commands, numbers, units, error strings, and
  negations (not, never, only, except).
- Use plain full sentences for security warnings, irreversible actions,
  questions with options, and multi-step instructions where clipped grammar
  could be misread.
- The user's own style instructions win over this section.

Files that persist (`scope.md`, `plan.md`, reports, README, `AGENTS.md`,
commit messages, code comments) stay in normal prose for human readers. They
should still be concise: tables over paragraphs, no filler.

## Never cut

Saving tokens by skipping a step costs more tokens later. Never trim:

- scope questions and plan approval
- the reproduction of a bug, and the regression test
- the full test suite, types, and lint before a step is called done
- evidence (`file:line`, command output) behind a claim
- security, accessibility, and error handling
