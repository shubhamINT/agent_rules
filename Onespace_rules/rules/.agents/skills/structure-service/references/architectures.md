# Architecture Patterns

"Structure" covers two things: the **architectural pattern** (how concerns are
separated and which way dependencies point) and the **folder layout** (how that
maps onto files). Pick the pattern first; the layout follows. Most production
backends are *layered, with business logic isolated from HTTP and the database*,
organised either by technical layer or by feature.

## 1. Pattern catalogue

| Pattern | Core idea | Fits | Watch out for |
|---------|-----------|------|---------------|
| **Layered (N-tier)** | Presentation → application/service → data access; each layer calls only the one below | Most backend APIs — the default | Anaemic "pass-through" layers that add nothing |
| **Layered, grouped by feature** (vertical slice) | Same layers, but folders per business area (`orders/`, `users/`), each with its own router/service/repository | Services with several business areas; teams that change one feature at a time | Features reaching into each other's internals — share via a feature's public module only |
| **Hexagonal (ports & adapters)** | Domain core in the centre; HTTP, DB, queues are adapters plugged into ports the core defines | Heavy domain logic that must be tested without infrastructure; several real adapters per port | Ports with one adapter (a hypothetical seam — see `coding-standards` module design) |
| **Clean / Onion** | Concentric rings: entities → use cases → interface adapters → frameworks; dependencies point inward only | Large, long-lived codebases whose rules must outlive framework choices | Ceremony: many files per use case in a small service |
| **Modular monolith** | One deployable, internally split into strongly bounded modules with explicit public interfaces | Growing products that want module boundaries without network calls | Modules sharing tables or importing each other's internals |
| **Domain-Driven Design** | Organise around bounded contexts and a shared domain language | Complex business domains; usually combined with hexagonal or feature layout | Applying tactical patterns (aggregates, repositories everywhere) to simple CRUD |
| **CQRS** | Separate write (command) and read (query) models/paths | Very read-heavy or event-sourced systems | Two models where one would do |
| **Event-driven** | Components communicate through events/queues rather than direct calls | Async workflows, decoupled integrations | Hidden control flow; needs idempotency, retries, dead-letter handling |
| **Microservices** | Independently deployable services, each owning its data | Large organisations needing independent deploy/scale | Distributed-systems cost; do not split what a module boundary would solve |
| **MVC / MVP / MVVM** | UI-layer patterns: model, view, controller/presenter/view-model | Server-rendered web apps (MVC); frontends | For a JSON API, "controller" = the HTTP handler layer inside one of the patterns above |

## 2. Detection signals

| You see | Likely pattern |
|---------|----------------|
| Top-level `controllers/`/`routes/`/`api/`, `services/`, `repositories/`/`dal/`, `models/` | Layered by layer |
| Top-level business nouns (`billing/`, `orders/`), each containing router + service + repository files | Layered by feature |
| `domain/` with no framework or driver imports; `ports/` + `adapters/`, or `application/` + `infrastructure/` | Hexagonal / clean |
| `modules/<name>/` each with an `index`/`__init__` exposing a small public surface, cross-module imports only via it | Modular monolith |
| `commands/` and `queries/` (or `handlers/` split that way) | CQRS |
| `events/`, `consumers/`, `publishers/`, queue clients central to flow | Event-driven |
| `views/`/`templates/` + `controllers/` | MVC |
| SQL or HTTP calls inside route handlers; one large module; two of the above side by side | Unstructured / mixed |

Confirm with imports, not only folder names: a folder called `domain/` that
imports FastAPI is not a hexagonal core.

## 3. The dependency rule

Whatever the pattern, dependencies point **toward business logic**, never away
from it:

- Business logic (domain / services / use cases) does not import the web
  framework, the HTTP request object, or the database driver.
- HTTP handlers and repositories/clients are the edges; they depend on the
  business logic, not the other way round.
- Configuration and logging are infrastructure everyone may import; they import
  no business code.

Check it: `rg -n "from fastapi|import express|from sqlalchemy|require\\('pg'\\)" src/<business-folder>`.

## 4. Choosing

Decide in this order and stop at the first match:

1. **The repo already follows one pattern consistently** (including the OneSpace
   variant — `src/api/routes/`, `src/services/<upstream>/`, `src/core/config.py`
   all present) → recommend **keeping it**.
2. **Anything else — new service, unstructured, or mixed code, however small** →
   recommend **layered, grouped by feature**. A service with one business area
   is simply one feature folder today; it grows without a later migration.
3. Offer the others as alternatives only, with their trade-off in one line:
   layered-by-layer (if the user prefers technical folders), hexagonal (heavy
   domain logic with several real adapters).

Never recommend the OneSpace variant for code that does not already follow it.
Always confirm with the user and record the result (see `SKILL.md` Step 4).
